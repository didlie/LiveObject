# LiveObject

Languages:
PHP / Javascript

Description:
The goal of this project is to create a live persistant RAM object using PHP on the server with a Javascript client script. "Object" refers to an object with an arbitrary number of key value pairs, where each value can be any kind of function, code snippet, or value of any type, JSON encoded and deliverable to the client.

Implementation:
This project will employ traditional websockets on both the server and client.

Peculiarities:
-A key can have only one value at any given moment.
-Methods can exist for the "ownership" of particular keys for editorial control.
-Methods can exist in other keys.
-An algorithm can also exist for securing as read-only particular keys for the implementation of more complex data structures; inlcuding a liveObject "database," a blockchain style method of exchange of ownership of particular keys and content control, and of course full application deployment as a single liveObject.
